# node_examples
This is a repository with some basic examples in node.js

The libraries we need to put on package.json are below:

  "excel-export": "^0.5.1",   // export to excel files

  "read-xml": "^3.0.0",       // read XML files


IÂ´ve read some links and this url below looks like the one that you need.
